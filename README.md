# Calculator
A simple (beginner-friendly) calculator made in Python 3

# Functions

# Steps 

Download the calc.py and then make it an exe by downloading pyinstaller ("pip install pyinstaller") and then making it an exe (Goto the directory of calc.py and then "pyinstaller calc.py --onefile")

# Known Bugs
- Cube root shows 3.999 etc for cube root of 64 where itshould show 4.

# Keep in mind

- Only decimals (1.99, 2.8 etc) and integers (-12, 3, 100 etc) are allowed. 
- Fractions (23/4, 33/5), blank spaces and special characters ( , @#$% etc) and alphabets (a-x, A-Z) are not allowed. Entering this will result in crashing of the app.

Any suggestions are welcome.

This is my first application in Python. This is extremely beginner friendly since I am a beginner myself. Took something like 2 hrs to make it atleast usable.

# Calculator
A simple (beginner-friendly) calculator made in Python 3

# Functions

- Addition
- Subtraction 
- Multiplication 
- Division 
- Square 
- Cube
- Square root
- Cube root

# Steps 

Download the calc.py and then make it an exe by downloading pyinstaller ("`pip install pyinstaller`") and then making it an exe (Goto the directory of calc.py and then "`pyinstaller calc.py --onefile`")

# Known Bugs
- Cube root shows x.999 (where x is an ddd number) etc for cube root of even numbers where it should show the exact number without showing x.999 etc.
For example- cube root of 512 shows 7.999999999 whereas it should show 8.

# Keep in mind

- Only decimals (1.99, 2.8 etc) and integers (-12, 3, 100 etc) are allowed. 
- Fractions (23/4, 33/5), blank spaces and special characters ( , @#$% etc) and alphabets (a-x, A-Z) are not allowed. Entering this will result in crashing of the app.

Any suggestions are welcome.

This is my first application in Python. This is extremely beginner friendly since I am a beginner myself. Took something like 2 hrs to make it atleast usable.
